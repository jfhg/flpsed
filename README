flpsed is a pseudo PostScript editor. Pseudo, because you can't actually 
edit existing PostScript documents, but you can add arbitrary text lines to
existing documents.
It is useful for filling in forms etc. 

Usage:
- open an existing PostScript document.
- click anywhere on the document and type a text line.
- adjust the size of your text line
- the frame around the text shows, which text line has the focus.
- remove text, by hitting BackSpace.
- navigate within the document with the Page->next or Page->first menu buttons.
- save your document and preview it with ghostview or something
  similar.
- if you reopen the document with flpsed, you can edit the added text lines.

Features:
- add arbitrary text to existing PostScript documents.
- reedit text, that has been added with flpsed.

Restrictions:
- flpsed probably does not work on all existing PostScript documents.
  You simply have to test it.
- the view size is currently hardcoded DIN A4.
- flpsed is alpha software, so please backup your files, befor trying to 
  modify them.

Building:
- flpsed only works on X11-based systems.
- you need to have ghostscript installed.
- you need to have fltk-1.1.x from www.fltk.org installed.
- unpack the tarball and type "make".
