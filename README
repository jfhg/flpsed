=======


flpsed is a pseudo PostScript editor. Pseudo, because you can't actually 
edit existing PostScript documents, but you can add arbitrary text lines to
existing documents.
It is useful for filling in forms etc. 

Quick Start:
- Open an existing PostScript document.
- Click anywhere on the document and type a text line.
- The frame around the text shows, which text line has the focus.
- Click on the lower left corner of a text line to focus it or use the 
  Tab-key to cycle through the text lines on the current page. 
- Remove text, by hitting BackSpace.
- Move text lines by dragging them with the mouse or using the arrow keys.
- Navigate within the document with the Page->Next or Page->First menu buttons.
- Save your document and preview it with ghostview or something similar.
- If you reopen the document with flpsed, you can edit the added text lines.

Features:
- Add arbitrary text to existing PostScript documents.
- Reedit text, that has been added with flpsed.
- The overall structure of the PostScript document is not
  modified. flpsed only adds the additional text.
- Lines can be given names ("tags"). The text of these lines can
  be replaced in batch mode (no X11 required).
 
Restrictions:
- flpsed probably does not work on all existing PostScript documents.
  You simply have to test it for your documents.
- flpsed is alpha software, so please backup your files, before trying to 
  modify them.

Building:
- flpsed only works on X11-based systems.
- You need to have ghostscript installed.
- You need to have fltk-1.1.x from www.fltk.org installed.
- Unpack the tarball and type "make".



Tags and Batch Mode:

To use batch mode, add text lines to your PostScript document as usual. 
Give all or some of the lines tag names (Tags->Edit Tag). 
Save the document. Now you can replace the text of the tagged line in batch
mode using the -t flag (see usage).
Example:
Lets assume you have added text lines with tags "name", and "street"
to your document letter.ps with flpsed in interactive mode and saved the
result in letter-templ.ps.
You can now call flpsed in batch mode to set the actual values:

flpsed -b -t name="Hans Meier" -t street="Haupstr. 14" letter-templ.ps out.ps
